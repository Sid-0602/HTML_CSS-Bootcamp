      <h3>Apollo 11 rocket successfully landed on the red planet.</h3>
  
      <p>
          Apollo 11 (July 16â€“24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the 
          Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong
          and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, 
          at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
          became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on 
          July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin
          joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together 
          exploring the site they had named
          Tranquility Base upon landing.
